# HydroPi (development)

HydroPi is a Raspberry Pi-based system designed to monitor and sample mead batch data in real-time. It collects gravity and temperature readings using smart hydrometers or sensors and sends the data to a Firebase backend for live updates and tracking.

## Features
- Collects gravity and temperature readings from smart hydrometers or custom sensors.
- Sends real-time data to a Firebase Function API endpoint.
- Easy setup with automated installation scripts.
- Modular and extensible codebase for additional sensors or data points.

## Use Case
HydroPi is perfect for meaderies or hobbyists looking to integrate technology into their brewing process. It simplifies batch monitoring and ensures accurate, up-to-date records for better quality control.
